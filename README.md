# Skincare Ingredient Analysis Tool  

This project is a tool for analyzing skincare product ingredient lists. Built with **Python**, it demonstrates skills in **web scraping**, **AI-driven data cleaning**, and designing **scalable data processing pipelines**.  

The tool processes ingredient lists and outputs a JSON file with at least **50% ingredient similarity**, helping users identify similar products based on their ingredient composition.  

## Project Highlights  

- **Web Scraping**: Leveraged libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium` to extract ingredient data from multiple skincare retailer websites.  
- **AI-Driven Data Cleaning**: Integrated `ChatGPT` to clean ingredient lists by removing non-relevant text, showcasing proficiency in AI-driven workflows.  
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Designed a scalable pipeline using Python and Pandas to handle large datasets in CSV format, paving the way for advanced analysis.  

## Current Features  

- **Ingredient Matching**: Outputs a JSON file with products that have at least 50% ingredient similarity to the user's input.  
- **AI-Powered Cleaning**: Ensures accurate and consistent processing of ingredient data for better usability.  
- **Scalable Storage**: Stores data in SQL databases for easy retrieval and scalability.  

## Skills Demonstrated  

- **Python Development**: Built a structured codebase for data processing and analysis.  
- **Web Scraping**: Scraped 800+ products from multiple websites, showcasing expertise in automation and data extraction.  
- **AI Integration**: Applied ChatGPT to solve real-world data cleaning challenges.  
- **Data Analysis**: Designed a system that provides meaningful insights through ingredient similarity scoring.  

## Usage  

To use the tool, provide a string of ingredients as input, and the tool will return products that share at least 50% similarity in ingredients.
